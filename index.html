      <h2>Achlasia</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="DiseaseInfo">
      <p>Achalasia, otherwise known as cardiospasm, is a rare swallowing disorder that affects the esophagus (the tube
        between the throat and the stomach). In people with achalasia, the esophagus muscles do not contract properly
        and do not help propel food down toward the stomach. Achalasia typically affects adults between 30 and 60 years
        of age, with a peak in the 40s. The disorder is about twice as common in men than women.</p>

      <p>
      <h3>The causes: </h3>The causes of achalasia are unknown, but researchers are exploring several theories. One is
      related to degeneration of the nerve cells located between the layers of esophageal muscles. These nerve cells
      enable the esophagus to push food toward and into the stomach. There is also evidence that achalasia may be an
      inflammatory autoimmune disorder, which means it could be caused by the body attacking itself.</p>

      <p>
      <h3>The affects: </h3>Some achalasia symptoms are caused by food piling up in the esophagus and being unable to
      pass into the stomach. As the esophagus fills up, it widens and can become twisted.</p>

      <h3>There are three types.</h3>
      <p>Type 1 (is sometimes called classic achalasia). With this type, the esophagus muscles barely contract, so food
        moves down because of gravity alone.</p>

      <p>Type 2 pressure builds up in the esophagus, causing it to become compressed. This is the most common type of
        achalasia and it often causes more severe symptoms than type I.</p>

      <p>Type III also called spastic achalasia because there are abnormal contractions at the bottom of the esophagus
        where it meets the stomach. This is the most severe type of achalasia. The contractions can cause chest pain
        that can awaken a person from sleep and imitate the symptoms of a heart attack.</p>

      <p>
      <h3>Treatment: </h3>Currently, no treatments resolve achalasia entirely, but there are several approaches to
      relieve symptoms, such as dilation (widening it), surgery, botulinum toxin injections and medications. The goal of
      treatment is to normalize contra</p>

      <p>
      <h3>Diet: </h3>They have to avoid certain foods like raw fruits/vegetables, touch cut meats, highly acidic foods
      such as citrus fruits, alcohol, caffeine</p>
